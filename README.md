# ReactNative-Counter

First app develped using React Native. It plays with the creation of screens, component and the use of hooks. 

It also includes some styling games, especially with flexbox.

Written with Typescript :)

## Getting started

After installing the dependencies run

```
npx expo start
```

This will automatically build the app and deploy it in your simulation.
